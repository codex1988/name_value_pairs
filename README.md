19. Write a program where you first enter a set of name-and-value pairs, such
as Joe 17 and Barbara 22. For each pair, add the name to a vector called
names and the number to a vector called scores (in corresponding positions, so that if names[7]=="Joe" then scores[7]==17). Terminate input
with NoName 0. Check that each name is unique and terminate with an
error message if a name is entered twice. Write out all the (name,score)
pairs, one per line.
